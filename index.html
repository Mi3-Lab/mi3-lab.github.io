    <h2 class="section-title">About Our Lab</h2>
    <p>The Mi<sup>3</sup> Lab at UC Merced researches machine intelligence, interaction, and imagination to develop safer autonomous vehicles, robots, and human-interactive intelligent systems. Our primary focus is on <strong>safe autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems</strong>, where we work to ensure that self-driving vehicles can safely interact with all road users—including first responders, pedestrians, cyclists, and vulnerable populations.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">We address critical challenges such as how autonomous vehicles should respond to emergency vehicles, how to make mobility accessible for all populations, and how intelligent systems can understand both verbal and non-verbal human communication. Our research spans artificial intelligence, computer vision, multimodal machine learning, and human-robot interaction, with a strong emphasis on safety validation, explainability, and real-world deployment.</p>
