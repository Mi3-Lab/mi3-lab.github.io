    <h2 class="section-title">About Our Lab</h2>
    <p>The Mi<sup>3</sup> Lab at UC Merced researches machine intelligence, interaction, and imagination to develop safer autonomous vehicles, robots, and human-interactive intelligent systems. We work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and human-computer interaction to create systems that can understand and safely navigate the complexities of the real world.</p>
